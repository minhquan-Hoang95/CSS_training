# CSS_training
Today is a good day to continue
I did the excercises of " The Odin Project"
And that's what I have finished with them
Through their excercises, I have learnt many things with CSS stuff like:
Ex1 : CSS method to link a file CSS
Ex2: How to declare " Class ID seletors"
Ex3: How to group the selectors
Ex4 : How to chain the selectors
Ex5: How to rule with the descendant combinators
Ex6: How to fix and understand deeply " The Cascade and The Specificity in CSS"
